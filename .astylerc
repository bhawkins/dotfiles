# I want conditions and functions to have the parens padded like in GNU code:
# "if (true) {"
# "z = foo (x, y);"
# However the astyle options mess up some stuff I think is fine:
# "if ((true) && (true)) {"
# "sizeof(int)"
# "(double)x"
# So leave these options out when they add more work than they save.
